# TABLEAU Project

This project includes interactive Customer and Sales Dashboards , designed in Tableau. These dashboards provide insights into key metrics for both customer behavior and sales performance, alongside a filter slicer panel that allows users to customize their view by selecting different criteria like year, location, and product categories.

The Customer Dashboard provides insights into customer-related metrics, including total orders, sales per customer, and customer distribution. Key features include:

Total Orders: Displays the number of customer orders for 2022 with a comparison to 2021, showing the percentage increase.
Customer per Sales: Shows sales per customer in 2022 compared to the previous year.
Total Customers: Indicates the unique number of customers for 2022 and year-over-year growth.
Customer Distribution by Number of Orders: A bar chart visualizing customer distribution based on order frequency.
Top 10 Customers: A table listing top customers by order count, including last order date, profit, total sales, and number of orders.
Sales Dashboard
The Sales Dashboard focuses on sales and profit metrics across different product sub-categories, showing both overall performance and specific category trends:

Total Sales: Tracks total sales in 2022 with a comparison to 2021, showing percentage growth.
Total Profit: Displays profit generated in 2022 compared to 2021.
Total Quantity (QNTY): Indicates the total quantity of items sold in 2022 versus 2021.
Sales and Profit by Sub-Category: A bar chart comparing sales and profit by product sub-category, identifying profitable and loss-making items.
Sales and Profit Trends: Dual line graphs showing monthly trends in sales and profit, with average sales and profit highlighted.
Filter Slicer Panel
The Filter Slicer Panel allows users to refine and customize their dashboard view by selecting filters for various criteria:

Year Selection: Filter data by year (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).
Location Filters: Filter by state, region, or city to focus on specific geographic areas.
Product Filters: Choose specific product categories and sub-categories to analyze performance at a more granular level.
This interactive panel enhances the user experience by enabling a more focused analysis of metrics, tailored to specific regions or products of interest.

Insights and Observations
Customer Dashboard:

A 26.69% increase in total orders and a 16.28% rise in customer sales indicate strong customer engagement and spending.
Distribution by order frequency shows a significant portion of one-time buyers, along with loyal customers who order frequently.
Sales Dashboard:

Sales and profit both saw significant growth in 2022, with sales up by 29.5% and profit by 32.74%.
The sub-category analysis provides insights into profitable and less profitable items, which can inform inventory and sales strategy.
Monthly trends indicate peak sales and profit months, helping identify seasonality.
